This repo is the deliverable for a Flutter developer role technical test for [Kagi](https://kagi.com/).

These were the most relevant instructions:

The project is to build a simple news aggregator application using Flutter. The core requirements are:

- implement category-based news feeds using the predefined categories at https://kite.kagi.com/kite.json
- Display news articles in a list view with appropriate metadata (title, source, date, etc.)
- Allow users to tap on articles to view a detailed summary

This project tests your ability not only to develop Flutter applications, but to deal with ambiguity and open-endedness

It should be fast and intuitive, giving users a quick overview of what's going on in the world

Things We Look For:

- Code quality and organization
- Problem-solving approach and technical choices
- Adding your own personal touches
